# ðŸ§  DNN Initialization personal Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementation of a each **DNN Initialization** from scratch using NumPy, inspired by the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Andrew Ng.

ðŸ“¦ Dataset
The dataset is synthetically generated using helper functions in `init_utils.py`:

- Binary classification dataset in 2D
- Visualized as points for two classes
- Used to demonstrate the impact of initialization on learning

ðŸ“š Concepts Practiced 
Parameter initialization strategies:  
- Zero initialization  
- Random initialization  
- He initialization
